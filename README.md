# Sportify Clone
The Spotify Clone is a responsive music streaming web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It replicates the core user interface and basic functionalities of Spotify, 
play/pause tracks, view progress bars, and switch between songs — all in a modern and interactive design.

# Features
✅ Modern UI Design – Fully responsive layout inspired by Spotify’s dark theme.
✅ Music Controls – Play, pause, next, and previous buttons work dynamically.
✅ Progress Bar – Shows current playback progress with time updates.
✅ Song List Display – Users can click on songs to play them instantly.

# Tech Stack
HTML5 – Structure of the web pages
CSS3 – Styling and responsive design
JavaScript (Vanilla JS) – Logic for audio control and interactivity

# How It Works-
The HTML file defines the layout (music player, song list, and controls).
CSS provides the dark, Spotify-inspired theme with hover and flexbox-based layout.
JavaScript manages the functionality:
Loads audio files dynamically.
Updates the progress bar and song title while playing.
Handles next/previous song switching.
